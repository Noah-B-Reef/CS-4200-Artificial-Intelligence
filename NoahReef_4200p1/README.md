# How to run program:
The main program is in the file titled ```main.py``` which once ran will prompt the user with the following:


1. How many puzzles the user wants to run
2. Manual or Random Puzzle input
3. Which Heuristic (Manhattan or Displaced Tiles)

The program will then display the puzzle it will run over and the steps to the solution. Lastly the program will display the search cost and total time of the algorithm.
