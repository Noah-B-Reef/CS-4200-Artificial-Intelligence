# How to run program:
The main program is in the file titled ```main.py``` which can be passed the following arguements: 

1. ```main.py uphill_ascent``` will run the uphill ascent algorithm on a randomly generated state and print out the solution and search cost
2. ```main.py genetic``` will run the genetic algorithm (Note that it may take awhile to converge, if so restart the program)
3. ```main.py experiment``` will run the experiment with uphill ascent and remake the ```uphill_climbing.csv```
